## About the project
This project, developed for my college Artificial Intelligence course, focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale clothing images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The objective is to create a machine learning model that accurately identifies various clothing types, such as T-shirts, trousers, and dresses. By utilizing CNNs, the project enhances image classification performance, with potential applications in fashion recommendation systems and automated image tagging.
